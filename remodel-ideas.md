# Home Remodel Things

Here are a few things to consider when remodeling your house.

- [ ] Have a seperate Hot water system for laundry / dishwasher vs. Showers / Baths (Separate tankless water heaters for bathrooms vs everything else)
- [ ] Make HVAC core easily accessable for clean / change filters (e.g. HVAC in garage)
- [ ] Have each room on own power circuit (color code the wires so you know what is what if you ever need to add a new outlet
- [ ] Networking Raceway in attic / conduit route in every room
- [ ] Put ceiling access point spots in house
- [ ] If stacking washer and dryer put a shut off valve for the water in a place you can easily get to (off to the side)
- [ ] UV filtering / electronic air filter in attic.
- [ ] Dedicated wiring closet with dedicated circuit with hvac (use booster fan to pull air out (make sure enough space at bottom of door)
- [ ] Magnetic hookup for dryer vent (also the vent should have a very short run so it is easy to clean out)
- [ ] Conduit to the doorbell
